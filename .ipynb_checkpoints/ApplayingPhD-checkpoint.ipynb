    "1.  __Choose your program/institution based on the research interests of the faculty.__  A number of prospective Ph.D. students tend to consider the institution and its rank first and foremost when searching for a program.  While these things matter, what is most important are the research interests and advising potential of the faculty.  Your first objective should be to find a program that houses a faculty member(s) whose work you are interested in and whom you may want as an advisor or mentor.  Aligning yourself with a scholar who is an expert in an area of interest of yours can pay dividends that can benefit you throughout your career.  In addition, when seeking academic jobs, the reputation and influence of the person who chairs and serves on your dissertation committee often holds more weight than the name of the institution or program."

    "2.  __Start the application process early.__  Applying for an academic program that can take, on average, 6-8 years to complete, cannot be done adequately in 6-8 days.  Allow yourself the greatest potential for completing a quality application by starting early.  Most application deadlines tend to be in the fall before you start the program.  This means you should begin gathering materials and working out a plan to apply the spring before the deadline.  For instance, if you would like a start a Ph.D. in August 2018, the deadline for applying is typically in October/November 2017.  Consequently, you should begin working on the application process in April/May 2017.  Do not damage your chances for acceptance by rushing and submitting a mediocre application."

    "3.  __Ask for recommendation letters far in advance of the application deadline.__  Graduate programs will request recommendation letters from their applicants.  Considering that most Ph.D. applicants will either be matriculating, or not far removed, from their master’s and undergraduate days, recommendation letter requests will usually go to past professors.  Please understand that professors are extremely busy people.  In addition to being unwise, it is downright disrespectful to ask a professor for a recommendation letter two weeks before it is due.  The average professor, or anyone for that matter, will not rearrange the short-term priorities in their life to accommodate your procrastination or unprofessionalism.  Be courteous and give your former professors at least 3 months to provide you a recommendation letter.  That will allow them to plan accordingly and gather their thoughts about you in a comfortable manner.  Anything less than two months and you place yourself in jeopardy of receiving a mediocre letter or not receiving one at all."

On the contrary, applicants should use the personal statement to show their potential as a scholar.  Briefly discussing potential research interests, stating reasons for pursuing such interests, and describing how you hope to add to the discipline are all important ideas to elaborate on in the personal statement.  You must show faculty in the program that you have the potential to develop new knowledge through the posing of an adequate research question."

Do not treat it like a general aptitude test that will measure your IQ just for the heck of it.  Allow yourself adequate time to prepare for the test.  Build time in your daily schedule to review math problems and study vocabulary and analogies.  When applying for a Ph.D. program leave nothing to chance, including the test that can make or break your acceptance into the program."

Many people do not know that it is not absolutely mandatory for you obtain a master’s degree before pursuing a doctorate.  Some fields allow students to enter a Ph.D. program right after completing an undergraduate degree.  If you are sure that receiving a Ph.D. is a goal of yours and necessary for your career path, you should seriously consider pursuing a doctorate after receiving your bachelor’s degree.

    "\n",
    "    One size does not fit all: Tailor your personal statement to each program and department you are applying to. Do your research to learn what is unique about each of your choices and highlight how this particular program stands out.\n",
    "    Yes, it’s personal: Showcase your unique strengths and accomplishments. Explain what influenced your personal decisions to pursue the program. Ask yourself, could this be applied to your friend or neighbor? If so, you need to be more specific and provide examples. Saying that you are a “good scientist” isn’t enough. Provide examples of your previous research experience, projects you’ve completed, and what technical skills you learned. Explain how you overcame any challenges along the way.\n",
    "    Set aside enough time:  Although personal statements are generally short in length (approx. 700 words; 1-2 pages), give yourself ample time to write a strong, well-written statement. It takes more time than you think to develop a final draft for submission.\n",
    "    Focus on your spelling, grammar, and vocabulary:  It’s important to present a well-written statement with good grammar and vocabulary. Write concrete, succinct sentences that flow well. Avoid flowery language. Visit the Writing Center for additional review and feedback.\n",
    "    Proofread one more time: Check your grammar and spelling again before submitting your final draft. Ask a friend, professor, or advisor to proofread your final draft one more time before sending it in. \n"

    "If you are applying to a PhD program, trying to figure out what to say in your statement of purpose or personal statement can be the hardest part of the application, but it is the most important. You are certainly not alone if you are getting stuck on what to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are tips for undergraduate and graduate students on writing these essays for doctoral applications. Many of these tips also apply to writing personal statements for other graduate program applications.\n",
    "1. Talk about Yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell us about you! The whole point of the essay is for you to tell us who you are. The essay should convey your intellectual trajectory and how to came to the decision to further your education. Do not waste space telling the university and faculty how great they are and how much of an honor it would be to study under such brilliant minds (they already think that). We want to know who you are.\n",
    "2. Explain Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the questions: Why do you want to obtain this degree? Why do you want to focus on this field (e.g. economics, finance, organizational behavior)? Why do you wish to study at this particular university?\n",
    "3. Show Fit\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell us how you fit with our program. Answer the question: Why are you a good match for this program? While point one says you should avoid showering faculty with praise, you should demonstrate knowledge of the program. Such knowledge is available on the program’s website or by talking with people in the program. Your essay should demonstrate knowledge of the university’s research and how you and your interests fit with that.\n",
    "4. Display Your Intellectual Curiosity\n",
    "\n",
    "What ideas and questions get you excited? Do you truly enjoy doing research? Why? Give us some examples that display your intellectual curiosity in action.\n",
    "5. Do Not Focus on Teaching\n",
    "\n",
    "PhD programs are all about training you to do high-quality, independent research. That is the purpose. In your statement, an emphasis on a love for teaching can be detrimental if it comes across as your primary objective. It is true that having a PhD qualifies you to become a university instructor. However, teaching may or may not be a part of your doctoral program. Even if it is, the faculty will want to see that you are focused on research.\n",
    "6. Include Research Experience and Skill Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Help out the admissions committee by highlighting any relevant experience and skills you have. Be sure to point out any research experience in your essay even if mentioned on your resume. Such experience, in any context, helps demonstrate your interests and skill set. Also be sure to mention any other relevant skills for research that you may possess such as computer programming (e.g. C++, Python, etc.), software (e.g. SPSS, MATLAB, STATA) and writing. Be sure to highlight any recognition you received for writing; high level writing skills are a major plus.\n",
    "7. Address Past “Issues” Directly\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any “black marks” on your record, such as poor grades, leaving a college program or any other issues, it is strongly advised that you address these head on in your letter. Admissions committees will not react well if it appears you are hiding or avoiding a topic. Failure is a common event in research. Showing how you successfully rebounded from setbacks bodes well for you.\n",
    "8. Proofread, edit, proofread, edit, proofread, edit\n",
    "\n",
    "This tip, you’d think, should go without saying. But, surprisingly, we often see sloppily written essays with typos, poor grammar, addressed to a different university and any other number of mistakes that could have easily been fixed. Be sure to ask others to proofread these essays for you. A sloppy essay signals you would be a sloppy researcher.\n",
    "9. Be Cautious in Focusing Too Much on Work Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have work experience in the field, please note that this is not always helpful in applying to PhD programs. If you can link your work experience to your motivation and the relevant research topics, great! Be sure to do that. Having 5, 10 or 15+ years of experience may make you an excellent employee or manager, but that does not always translate into the academic research environment.\n",
    "10. Circulate your Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, be sure to share your essays with your recommendation writers. That helps them write stronger letters of support for you and ensures what they say is consistent with what you are saying. Furthermore, if you have drafts of your essay completed early enough, it is reasonable to ask them for feedback. They may not have time, but most faculty are quite willing to help their former students out if given sufficient notice.\n"

    "### How to Write a Successful Statement of Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "8 tips with examples that helped me get admitted to CS programs at Carnegie Mellon University, Stanford, UC Berkeley\n",
    "\n",
    "Around this time last year, I started preparing my graduate applications for universities in the US to pursue a Master’s program involving AI. Graduating from the first cohort of a brand new Bachelor’s program in France, having little research or industry experience, and no publications, I was more determined than ever to produce a statement of purpose (SoP) that will help me stand out from the pool of brilliant applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few months later, I was delighted to receive admission from all my top choices! Though at first, I had no idea what an SoP was, I must have done something right to have convinced people from all these prestigious universities. To give back to the community, I thought I’d share a few tips I learned or found useful during my SoP writing :)\n",
    "\n",
    "For those interested, I’ll also include my stats during the time of application, my full essay, programs I was accepted to, programs I was rejected from, and which program I chose at the end of this post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disclaimer: I am just a recent graduate who likes machine learning and blogging and blogging about machine learning, I am by no means qualified to teach how to write essays. The following tips merely reflect my personal experience applying to US Master’s degrees in CS and may not always be generalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Don’t procrastinate this essay\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I am well aware of a student’s superhuman productivity in producing pages of an essay they left to do last-minute. But trust me, I strongly encourage you to start thinking about your SoP well before your application deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what my timeline looked like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start September — I googled “how to write statement of purpose” and created my SoP.docx file\n",
    "\n",
    "Start October — I had my first draft ready to ask others to proofread\n",
    "\n",
    "Start November — I revised my first draft to ask others to proofread a second time\n",
    "\n",
    "End November — I had a “general” SoP ready, which I still had to “fine-tune” for each program I was considering\n",
    "\n",
    "December-January — For each program, I finalized each SoP before submitting my application\n",
    "\n",
    "February 3 — I received my first response: accepted to my dream program!\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, it took 3 months of planning and writing my SoP. Some might need more time or less. My point is, it’s not an essay that can or should be rushed, it’s good to give yourself time to think about what you want to say, get feedback from others, and re-write it several times.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel lost on how to get started, my advice is to create that document anyways and jot down any ideas you have, even the silly ones. From there, you’ll be able to start stringing these ideas into a flow of text, or come up with new ideas when you didn’t expect it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Statement of Purpose ≠ Personal Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the personal statement for my undergraduate application, most graduate schools do not give clear prompts or questions you need to answer. A common mistake is thinking the graduate SoP is like a “personal statement with more experience”.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Personal Statement is personal, you should write who you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Statement of Purpose, on the other hand, should center around what you plan to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the important questions you should answer in your SoP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    What are your interests, motivations, and goals? What sparked them?\n",
    "    What relevant experience do you have? What have you learned that makes you well-prepared for graduate studies?\n",
    "    How does this graduate program help achieve your goals? What do you plan to do at this program?\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the reviewer is essentially looking for potential as a successful graduate student in your essay, so your main goal is to convince you are skilled and motivated to undertake your graduate studies.\n",
    "#### 3. Keep it structured\n",
    "\n",
    "You want your SoP to be pleasant for your reviewer to read. It’s important that your ideas are structured and flows nicely, so that the reviewer doesn’t need to guess what you’re trying to convey or jump between ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how I structured my essay:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Grab the reader’s attention before stating my general goal\n",
    "    Describe my previous experiences towards this goal\n",
    "    State what I’ve learned and qualities that make me successful\n",
    "    Re-state goal, but with more detail\n",
    "    Explain what I still need to learn and how the program will help me grow\n",
    "    End on an enthusiastic, positive tone :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Yours might not look like mine, but the general takeaway is to have a clear message/purpose for each paragraph/section.\n",
    "#### 4. Stay concise, relevant, focused\n",
    "\n",
    "A good rule of thumb is to keep your essay under 2 pages long. Though you might have lots to say, it’s important to be selective of details you want to include, since reviewers probably have hundreds of essays to get to.\n",
    "\n",
    "What worked for me was to write everything I wanted at first, and from there reformulate wordy phrases and omitting unnecessary detail. Make sure that everything you say is a crucial detail for why you are the ideal graduate candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, ask yourself “what message do I want to convey with this?” for each sentence. Don’t just describe what you did in your project, make sure to state what you learned, what this proves about you:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In my first programming project, I lead a team of 8 to build a LSTM neural network in C++ for music composition. I had no machine learning experience at the start of the project, and in 4 months, I assimilated the technical skills and machine learning notions needed to build and train the neural network. I also learned to design a machine learning project, from data retrieval and embedding to user interface for the model demo, and distribute these tasks within a team efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Stand out from the start\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal essay captures the reader’s attention right from the start and guides them through your ideas until the end. Don’t go for a generic introduction and be creative!\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of starting your essay with “My goal is to study Artificial Intelligence and develop technologies that help people” — which really won’t make your intro memorable or captivating — think of an anecdote, a reference, or even a joke that helps you ease into your main message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how I started mine before moving on to explain my research goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "    When my mother first started using a smartphone, she only used it to call. She wouldn’t use other functionalities, such as looking up directions, until I taught her to orally ask the virtual assistant what she needs. This lead me to believe Natural Language Processing will bridge the gap between humans and modern technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Show, don’t tell\n",
    "\n",
    "Admissions are looking for evidence you are the best fit for their program. Anyone can say “I am very determined, hardworking and also I’m a very quick learner” but it won’t make you stand out.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stronger message is to cite an example, in work or class or outside, that illustrates the quality you claim to have. For example, here’s what I said instead of “I am very determined, hardworking”:\n",
    "\n",
    "    With minimal experience in AI, I secured my NLP internship after attending 4 networking events, distributing 50 resumes and having 10 interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Be specific about your area and your program\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike undergraduate studies, graduate admissions are looking for students who will work closely with them in the program’s study area. You are their potential research assistants, teaching assistants, PhD students…\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to show you know what kind of work they’re doing and you have the specific skills that fit into their area of expertise. Don’t hesitate to use technical terms when describing your experience!\n",

    "    After becoming familiar with language modeling and self-attention, I built on recent research where I used cloze translation to synthesize question answering data. I also learned to code BiDAF and BERT models in PyTorch and perform cloud computing.\n",

    "Also, it’s good to stalk some faculty and activities of your program, and show it’s not just any program, but this specific program you desire. You can cite papers you found interesting or courses you’d like to take:\n",

    "    I am particularly determined to join the [university NLP lab] and research NLP for social good under the guidance of [really cool Prof #1], multilingual language analysis tools and reading comprehension with [really cool Prof #2]. I also want to incorporate [really cool Prof #3]’s work in [really cool paper] to my research on unsupervised question answering for adversarial training of robust unsupervised QA systems.\n",

    "An important step of SoP writing for me was getting feedback from different people, and reworking my essay over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of people you can ask to read over your essay are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your academic advisors/counseling team: they are usually the most experienced in proofreading SoPs and giving writing tips\n",
    "    Your letter of recommendation writers: they probably have the expertise in the relevant area of study to fully understand your essay, and they might have experience reviewing SoPs for admissions too. My CS prof even corrected me on a technical detail I included!\n",
    "    Your friends: either they’ve written SoPs before, or they’re in the same boat as you and can share personal tips\n",
    "    Your family: my dad was probably the least helpful proofreader, he literally sent me back “I am convinced with no further comment.” on my first draft that has almost nothing in common with my final draft. They’ll still be happy to read your essay and give you encouragement!\n",
    "\n",
    "I spent most of my time editing every detail of my essay until I had nothing else to change. Also, my first draft looks nothing like my final draft. This is why I highly encourage to start working on your SoP soon, to leave time for others to read it and give you multiple feedback :)    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ending note\n",
    "\n",
    "The SoP may seem daunting at first, and it did take lots of work, but I still had lots of fun writing mine! It was a great exercise to formulate my specific interests, structure my experiences, and extract lessons I learned from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also forced me to reflect precisely on my motivations and even helped me understand what I was really looking for in my graduate studies. There were even programs I was preparing to apply, where I even obtained recommendation letters for, but while writing my SoP I realized it wasn’t what I wanted, and I ended up discarding my application."
