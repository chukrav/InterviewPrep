    "* programming — some programming experience is necessary. Machine Learning is not a place to take baby steps in programming. If you cannot code, take one of many Programming 101 courses. Python is a good language of choice."

    "\n",
    "Your first steps should lead to [Stanford Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) class at Coursera by Andrew Ng. This course is simply brilliant! Along a way, you will be given everything you need to know, including algebra review. You will not only get the overview of supervised and unsupervised techniques but you will gather hands on experience through coding assignments in Octave (or Matlab). Pull in your weight and you will gain a lot of self-confidence. You will probably reach peak in Dunning-Kruger Effect.\n",

    "It’s time to buy better shoes. There are plenty of options, but two stands out: Python and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two have strong and opinionated believers. Among people I met, those with math background prefer R and those with roots in CS get along with Python. I would recommend to start with Python. It is beautiful language and you will get faster to exciting stuff. The most popular ML library for Python is scikit-learn. To make your work convenient try out interactive environments: ipython is better console for python and Jupyter is programming notebook which works also with R. Data processing can be done with PANDAS.\n",

It is time to learn R and become [Data Scientist](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) with John Hopkins specialization on Coursera. It is 9 classes that will teach you data scientist toolkit, data exploration and visualization, statistical inference and regression. Everything is wrapped up with the capstone project.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning) from Data Science specialization probably opened your eyes that there is more into ML than Andrew Ng taught you. Get deep into the field of [Statistical Learning with Stanford](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about) course by Rob Tibshirani and Trevor Hastie. These two and Jerome Friedman are the authors of ML Bible Elements of [Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) which is available online for free.  \n",
    "You may feel that you need to supplement your knowledge of probability. There is a great class from MIT Introduction to Probability — The Science of Uncertainty on edX. I would also recommend a great book: Introduction to Probability by course instructor John N. Tsitsiklis."

If you want to learn more, take two great classes at Berkley via edX: [Introduction to Big Data](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS100.1x/1T2015/info) with Apache Spark and [Scalable Machine Learning](https://courses.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS190.1x/1T2015/info)."
