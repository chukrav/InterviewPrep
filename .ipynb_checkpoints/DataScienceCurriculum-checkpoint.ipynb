    "\n",
    "Learn essential components of a good data visualization. A good data visualization is made up of several components that have to be pieced up together to produce an end product:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Data Component: An important first step in deciding how to visualize data is to know what type of data it is, e.g., categorical data, discrete data, continuous data, time-series data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Geometric Component: Here is where you decide what kind of visualization is suitable for your data, e.g., scatter plot, line graphs, bar plots, histograms, Q-Q plots, smooth densities, boxplots, pair plots, heatmaps, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Mapping Component: Here, you need to decide what variable to use as your x-variable and what to use as your y-variable. This is important, especially when your dataset is multi-dimensional with several features.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Scale Component: Here, you decide what kind of scales to use, e.g., linear scale, log scale, etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "f) Ethical Component: Here, you want to make sure your visualization tells the true story. You need to be aware of your actions when cleaning, summarizing, manipulating, and producing a data visualization and ensure you aren’t using your visualization to mislead or manipulate your audience.\n",

    "\n",
    "10. __Data Science Project Planning Basics__\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn basics on how to plan a project. Before building any machine learning model, it is important to sit down carefully and plan what you want your model to accomplish. Before delving into writing code, it is important that you understand the problem to be solved, the nature of the dataset, the type of model to build, how the model will be trained, tested, and evaluated. Project planning and project organization are essential for increasing productivity when working on a data science project. Some resources for project planning and organization are provided below."
