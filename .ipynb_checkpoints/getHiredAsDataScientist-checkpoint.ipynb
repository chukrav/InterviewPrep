    "### 1. Featuring trivial projects on your resume\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s hard to think of a faster way to have your resume thrown into the “definite no” pile than featuring work you did on trivial proof-of-concept datasets among your highlighted personal projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "When in doubt, here are some projects that hurt you more than they help you:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Survival classification on the Titanic dataset.\n",
    "* Hand-written digit classification on the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "* Flower species classification using the iris dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Why it hurts you__\n",
    "\n",
    "Space on a resume is limited. Candidates know it, and so do recruiters. So if “training wheel datasets” like MNIST are taking up some of that precious space, it can raise questions in recruiters’ minds about how far along you could really be in your data science journey. \n",
    "\n",
    "__What to do about it__   \n",
    "If your resume features these kinds of projects — and if you don’t have other, more challenging and substantial ones to replace them with — it’s a strong indication that you need to put some serious time into building up your portfolio.\n",

    "Of course, if you do have other, more interesting projects to showcase, then you’ll definitely want to swap them in.   \n",
    "\n",
    "__Exceptions__   \n",
    "It’s entirely possible to build sophisticated projects using well-studied datasets like MNIST or the Titanic Dataset. If you’re playing with a new kind of GAN you’ve invented, or you’re replicating an interesting capsule network paper, then go for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "But keep in mind that most recruiters are nontechnical, and they often work simply by looking for keywords, so you’ll have to make it very clear that your MNIST project involves more than just the trivial digit classification task."

    "\n",
    "Massive online open courses (MOOCs) like Udacity, Coursera and deeplearning.ai are fantastic ways to dive into deep learning and data science. Having said that, many companies look at candidates with skepticism if that’s all they have to show for themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "___Some things to avoid:___   \n",
    "\n",
    "    Having a portfolio that largely consists of projects you’ve completed as part of your nanodegree/program.\n",
    "    Listing your MOOC too prominently, or as the very first data science-related component on your resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Why it hurts you__   \n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a fair bit of ego that goes into hiring. Companies want to be able to say that they only hire “very special people”, or “the top 1% of applicants”, etc. And because so many people now have MOOC certifications, it’s easy to be typecast as just another Udacity grad, which makes you sound less special.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recruiters are now familiar enough with many MOOCs to instantly recognize projects that are part of a standard nanodegree or MOOC (e.g. Udacity’s traffic sign classification task, which is nontrivial and even somewhat interesting, is featured on a disproportionate number of resumes). To sound special, you need to focus on problems that aren’t as well-explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** I want to be clear about something here: ___Udacity, Coursera and deeplearning.ai___ are awesome programs. They’re also legitimately correlated with hireability and technical ability (according to our own data). But putting them at the top of your list of advertised data science experience — with few other projects/experience — sets off red flags for recruiters who are looking for “someone really special”.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__What to do about it__   \n",
    "As soon as you finish your course or nanodegree, you’ll want to strike out on your own, and take part in Kaggle competitions, or replicate the results of interesting papers in the data science literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "__This is important because it:__   \n",
    "1. makes you look much more unique, \n",
    "2. gives you cutting-edge work to showcase and discuss during interviews, and \n",
    "3. shows that you’re capable of self-directed (and unsupported!) study.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Exceptions__   \n",
    "One exception to this rule are capstone projects you may have completed as part of your MOOC, provided that they’re unique. By unique, I mean that you had the freedom to choose the dataset you wanted, and to solve the problem end-to-end largely on your own. Because this is effectively no different from going rogue and working on a side-project by yourself, it’s less likely to hurt you."

    "\n",
    "Not including these bread-and-butter skills is also a great way to get skipped over by the median keyword-seeking recruiter, who is more interested in finding a reason to say “no”, than one to say “maybe”.\n",
